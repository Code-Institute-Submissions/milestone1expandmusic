# Milestone 1 Project - Expand music
---
The first milestone project from the Full Stack Developer course with Code Institute.

## Description
---
The project is made based on the first modules of the course that cover HTML CSS and Bootstrap technologies.
It also uses Google fonts links ref and fontawesome kit reference link for icons.

User Case
**Expand Music** is a company that provides two differenciated services. It is a school to learn to play instruments and it is also a store that can sell instruments to their students and general public.

The structure of the website has been mantained through all pages, there are 3 differenciated rows: 
one for the header hero-image and side menu
one for the central content part
one for the footer

The first and the third rows structure are kept identical for all the pages for simplicity and consistency, only changing the hero-image in the store and in the school.
The central part is what varies depending on what page the user is.


The user goal, then can also be differenciated into 2:
 * Buy an instrument. What instruments are sold in the site
 * Learn to play an instrument. What classes are offered for which instruments and the times

 Additionally the user want to know more about how the company provide those services and where are they located.

The site owner's goal.
* Get students enrolled
* Sell instruments
* Centralise the information enquiries and categorise them


## Features
---

Main home page with 2 blocks of options to choose if the user is interested in buying instruments or learning classes.
Courses page containing all offered courses and times
Store page containing all categories of instruments that are sold
Contact page containing a form for enquiries
About page for the users to know more about the company

*For simplicity purposes beeing this the first website project, the links shown on the store page to each category of instruments sold in the site are not taking anywhere else as no purchases catalogue page has been developed at this stage.*

## Design
---
Colors chosen are consistent through the whole website and playing with opacities: 
'#212529 for normal text and borders and #60342e borders  
'#cbcbc9 #f4f4f4 for backgrounds
'#b39f77 for some highlights and hovers

Imaginery consist of 3 pictures for the hero header and 4 images for the store instrument categories
Same font family for the website just changing their properties


## Support. Known issues still unsolved.
---
W3 HTML & CSS checkers reveal only minor issues related to XML mapping due to additional hyphens in comments and on the CSS only flagging unkonwn vendor extensions for -webkit -moz etc properties.
Only one significant error flagged related to a div used for the logo image showing inside an ul tag.

Common to all pages:
* To reduce the height and make it more responsive on phone sized screens for the first row class that contains the hero image and the side menu.

* The navbar side menu is not responsive and doesn't change to a toggler icon menu on phone sized small screens, it just dissapears.

* Position of buttons to be horizontally allignedat the bottom between 2 paralel text columns, without dependance of the amount of text that precees them in their box, as a higher amount of text makes them to show lower than the previous column paragraph.

* When on small devices screens, make the second row of content to ocuppy all width space, to give the content more breathing space, by removing the offset-2 that was set up for normal sized computer screens, or alternatively create a readmore functionality, so additional text is hidden by default on small screens unless you click on that readmore.
